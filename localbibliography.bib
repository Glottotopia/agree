@article{Quicoli:2008,
	Abstract = {This article provides evidence based on the phenomenon of reconstruction asymmetry in English, and anaphoric clitics in Romance to show that binding conditions -- more specifically condition A -- apply cyclically on the basis of information contained at te level of the syntactic phase. Given that cyclicity is a property of derivations, the facts analyzed here constitute evidence in favor of an essentially ``derivational'' approach to binding relations based on the central concept of syntactic phase. Evidence is also presented against LF analyses, which assume a ``representational'' approach to binding, and against an alternative derivaitonal approach, which assumes that binding principles apply at arbitrary points in the syntactic derivation.},

interpretations, I propose here that events with a definite end point
involve interpretation of the verb and either a bounded direct object
or a bounded PP in the checking domain of Asp(ect)P, whereas unbounded
events involve interpretation in a projection lower in the
clause. This analysis explains the syntactic behavior of the ambiguous
adverb quickly. In addition, it follows from the analysis that durative
adjuncts are adjoined to VP, while time frame adjuncts are adjoined
to AspP. Constructions involving preposition stranding, scope of only,
parasitic gaps, and semantic restrictions on adjunct PP objects support
this approach.},

  abstract      = {This paper claims (a) that the formal features of the goal are copied onto the probe in the Agree operation, contra Chomsky 2000 and more in line with Chomsky 1998, and (b) that formal features copied onto the probe during the Agree operation participate in binding in a selective way, contra Lasnik 1999. These claims are supported by a modification of Zwart's (1993, 1997) analysis of complementizer agreement and a minimalist reworking of Finer's (1984, 1985) theory of switch reference. It will also be shown that formal features deleted during Agree will not be carried anymore when the category containing them undergoes further movement. This assumption plays a key role in providing an account of complementizer agreement more constrained than Zwart's.},

Although DPs need Case to participate in Agree relations (Chomsky 2000), deletion-marked Case remains syntactically accessible until the next strong phase (Pesetsky and Torrego 2001), allowing CA and SA to cooccur. In Frisian, 'that' cannot agree in embedded VO clauses because it is in Force; the verb is in Fin', bearing CA (contra Zwart 1997).},

As in the early approach, there is not feature checking in intermediate positions of successive-cyclic movement. However, as in the current approach and unlike in early minimalism, successive-cyclic movement starts before teh final target of movement enters the structure, and Form Chain is eliminated. The locality of Move and the locality of Agree are shown to be radically different, Agree being free from several mechanisms that constrain Move, namely, phases and the Activation Condition. However, there is no need to take phases to define locality domains of syntax or to posit the Activation Condition as an independent principle. They still hold empirically for Move as theorems. The Generalized EPP (the "I need a Spec" property of attracting heads) and the Inverse Case Filter are also dispensable. The traditional Case Filter, stated as a checking requirement, is the sole driving force of A-movement. More generally, Move is always driven by a formal inadequacy (an uninterpretable feature) of the moving element, while Agree is target driven. The system resolves a lookahead problem that arises under the EPP-driven movement approach, where the EPP diacritic indicating that X moves is placed on Y, not X, although X often needs to start moving before Y enters the structure.},

hierarchies arise from the mechanism of Agree operating on articulated phi-feature structures in a cyclic syntax. Cyclicity and locality
derive a preference for agreement control by the internal argument.
Articulation of the probe determines (a) when the agreement controller
cyclically displaces to the external argument and (b) differences in
crosslinguistic sensitivity to person hierarchies. The system characterizes
two classes of derivations corresponding empirically to direct
and inverse contexts, and predicts the existence and nature of repair
strategies in the latter. The properties of agreement displacement thus
reduce to properties of syntactic dependency formation by Agree.},
